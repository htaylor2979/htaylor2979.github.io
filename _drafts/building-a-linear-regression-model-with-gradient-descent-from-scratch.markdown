## Introduction
The inspiration for this project came from Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning” course on Coursera.org. The projects for that course used Octave math coding language, which has many similar functions to Python’s Numpy library. With that in mind, I decided to practice what I learned in Professor Ng’s course by building a Logistic Regression model from scratch in Python. I chose a simple gradient descent method for training the model weights and then tested my code with the famous “iris” dataset that comes packaged with Python’s Scikit Learn library.
